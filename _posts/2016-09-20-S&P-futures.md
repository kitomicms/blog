The big futures contract was originally priced by multiplying the quoted futures price by $500.

For example, if the S&P was trading at $800, the value of the big contract was $400,000, or $500 x $800.

Eventually, the CME cut the contract multiplier in half to $250 times the price of the futures index.

E-mini futures are one-tenth the value of the big contract.

If the S&P 500 futures price is $800, this results in an e-mini being valued at $40,000.

The "e" in e-mini stands for electronic.
